Instead of hiding product categories in a dropdown or sidebar, this plugin puts them front and center with a stylish display that’s easy to customize and fully responsive.

### Perfect for:
* Clothing boutiques with seasonal collections.
* Gourmet food stores with multiple departments.
* Digital download shops with different file types.

With this plugin, you can create eye-catching category showcases without writing code. Simply choose a layout (Slider, Block, or Grid), pick your categories, and drop the generated shortcode anywhere on your site.

### Key benefits:
* Encourage browsing with modern category displays.
* Highlight featured or high-margin categories to increase sales.
* Provide a seamless shopping experience across desktop and mobile.
* Save time with a simple, shortcode-based setup.
